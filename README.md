E-car is project of application to acces data from Car using OBDII and expand car Graphical User Interface(GUI). 
It's project to develop my skills in web technologies- custom folder selector, custom media player, and more, enjoy!

Project assumptions:
  - using only JS, HTML5 and CSS
  - Electron framework to cross-platform run
  - Magic ;)
